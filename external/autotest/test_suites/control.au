This is the equivalent of the build verification suite but for autoupdate in the
sense that this suite contains the Autoupdate Verification tests that must pass
with every build.

Note: the control files used by this suite are auto-generated by Chromium OS
builds which use the template control file from
server/site_tests/autoupdate_EndToEndTest/control.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
