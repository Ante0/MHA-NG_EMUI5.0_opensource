This test will fail if:
1. Not logged In.
2. Battery charge state reports "Discharging" on Resume when AC is plugged to
   DUT in Suspend(S3) state.
3. Battery charge state reports "Charging" on Resume when AC is plugged to
   DUT in Suspend(S3) state.

The Command line args to run this test is as follow:
1. If DUT is connected to RPM(default), No need to pass any command line args.
2. If DUT is connected to USB powerstrip(servoj10), Need to pass
   --args=power_control="servoj10".
3. If DUT is not connected to either RPM or Servo and to run Manual, Need to
   pass --args=power_control="manual".
