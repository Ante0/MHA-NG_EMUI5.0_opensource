This is an end-to-end update test of Chrome OS releases. Given a test
configuration, it will perform an end-to-end test of a Chrome OS update
payload. A test configuration can be given as command-line arguments (see
below) or instantiated inline as local varibles.

To invoke this test locally:

  test_that --args="<ARGLIST>" <DUT-IPADDR> autoupdate_EndToEndTest

where ARGLIST is a whitespace separated list of the following key=value pairs.
Values pertaining to the test case include:

  name=TAG           name tag for the test (e.g. 'nmo', 'npo' or 'fsi')
  update_type=full|delta  type of update being applied, either 'full' or 'delta'
  source_release=REL      source image release version (e.g. 2672.0.0)
  target_release=REL      target image release version (e.g. 2673.0.0)
  source_payload_uri=URI  URI of the source full payload. None means don't
                          install a source image (assume it's preinstalled).
  source_archive_uri=URI  (optional) URI of where the artifacts for the source
                          image (e.g.  stateful update) are located. If not
                          provided, the test will attempt using the same
                          location as source_payload_uri.  This is required for
                          any test where the location of the full (source)
                          payload is separate from that of its build artifacts
                          (e.g. it is in gs://chromeos-releases/).
  target_payload_uri=URI  URI of the target payload
  target_archive_uri=URI  (optional) URI of where the artifacts for the target
                          image (e.g. stateful update) are located. If not
                          provided, the test will attempt using the test job's
                          repo ID (if present), otherwise default to the same
                          location as target_payload_uri.  Normally, this is
                          only needed for local (non-AFE) runs where the
                          payload location is separate from that of the build
                          artifacts (e.g. it is in gs://chromeos-releases).

Please note, this test spawns omaha server instances (devserver) on a devserver
configured in your global_config using autotest's ssh mechanism. This means that
if you are running this locally and intend to use a local devserver, you will
need to setup your ssh keys for public key authentication e.g. create keys,
ssh-add the private key, add the public key to your authorized keys and finally
enable public key authentication in your sshd config.

To run locally:
  Create src/third_party/autotest/files/shadow_config.ini:
    [CROS]
    devserver_dir = <full repo path>/src/platform/dev
    dev_server = http://<hostname>:8080

  Configure SSH for passwordless loopback access to your account.
    ssh-keygen (If you don't already have SSH keys setup)
    cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa chroot/home/<user>/.ssh/

    # This is NOT permanent, you'll have to redo it about once a day.
    sudo sed -i 's/PubkeyAuthentication no/PubkeyAuthentication yes/' \
        /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart

    Enter a chroot, and ssh to <hostname>. If it doesn't work, fix that.

  Make sure you have your gsutil permissions (your .boto file).
    Your .boto file must be available inside the chroot.
    cp ~/.boto chroot/home/<user>/

  Make sure the gsutil command is available outside the chroot (note:
  the gsutil package in Ubuntu is not what you're looking for.)

  Start a devserver (outside the chroot):
    src/platform/dev/devserver.py

  (Note: DO NOT use start_devserver! Even though it gives the impression of
  running the server outside the chroot, it actually starts a chroot and runs
  the server inside of it.)

  To make sure your test edits are used:
    cros_sdk
    cros_workon start autotest

  Example:
    cros_sdk
    test_that <dut_ip> autoupdate_EndToEndTest \
      --args="target_release=<Target Build Id> \
              source_payload_uri=<Full Payload URI> \
              target_payload_uri=<Tested Payload URI>"

  Sample full payload URL:
    gs://chromeos-image-archive/lumpy-release/R30-4462.0.0/
    chromeos_R30-4462.0.0_lumpy_full_dev.bin

  Sample target build id:
    4463.0.0

  Sample test payload URL:
    gs://chromeos-image-archive/lumpy-release/R30-4463.0.0/
