This test will fail if:
1. "power_supply_info" state value reports "Discharging" when AC plugged or
    online value is "no".
2. "power_supply_info" state value reports "Charging" when AC Unplugged or
    online value is "yes".

The Command line args to run this test is as follow:
1. If DUT is connected to RPM(default), No need to pass any command line args.
2. If DUT is connected to USB powerstrip(servoj10), Need to pass
   --args=power_control="servoj10".
3. If DUT is not connected to either RPM or Servo and to run Manual, Need to
   pass --args=power_control="manual".
