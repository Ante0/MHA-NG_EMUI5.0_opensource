Kicks off the Dummy Server suite on a Moblab host against the DUTs on its
subnet and ensures the suite completes successfully.

To invole this test locally:
  test_that -b stumpy_moblab <remote> moblab_DummyServerSuite
  --args="<ARGLIST>"

where ARGLIST is a whitespace separated list of the following key=value pairs.
Values pertaining to the test case include:

  boto_path=<boto_path>                path to the boto file to be installed on
                                       the Moblab DUT. If not specified, the
                                       boto file in the current home directory
                                       will be installed if it exists.
  image_storage_server=<server_name>   Google Storage Bucket from which to
                                       fetch test images from. If not
                                       specified, the value will be fetched
                                       from global_config.
