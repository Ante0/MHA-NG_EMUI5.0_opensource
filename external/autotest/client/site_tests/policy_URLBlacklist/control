Verify effects of policy_URLBlacklist policy on client behavior & appearance.

This test verifies the effect of the URLBlacklist user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior and appearance. It exercises a range of policy values using three
unique test cases, named: NotSet, SingleBlacklistedFile and MultipleBlacklistedFiles. See the test file for a
full description of what each test case does.

A test case shall pass if the URLs that are not part of the URLBlacklist policy value
are not blocked.
The test case shall also pass if the URLs that are part of the URLBlacklist policy value
are blocked.
A test case shall fail if the above behavior is not enforced.

Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> policy_URLBlacklist --args="mode=single case=MultipleBlacklistedFiles
env=dm-test dms_name=xot-dmst username=test@crosprqa1.com password=test1234"

Runs a single test case (e.g., MultipleBlacklistedFiles) using the specified test DM Server
environment, signing in with the specified username and password. Expectation
is that the page will be blocked.
