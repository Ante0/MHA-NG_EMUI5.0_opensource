Verify effects of JavaScriptBlockedForUrls policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the JavaScriptBlockedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior when user policy DefaultJavaScriptSetting=1, meaning
allow JavaScript on all pages except for those in JavaScriptBlockedForUrls.
It exercises a range of policy values using four unique named test cases:
NotSet_AllowJS, SingleUrl_BlockJS, MultipleUrls_AllowJS, and
MultipleUrls_BlockJS. See the test file for a full description of what each
test case does.

In general, a test shall pass if the browser blocks JavaScript execution only
on a test page with a URL that matches one or more of the URL patterns listed
in JavaScriptBlockedForUrls. A test shall fail if the browser allows execution
on a page where it should be blocked, or blocks execution on a page where it
should be allowed.

Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> JavaScriptBlockedForUrls --args="mode=single
case=SingleUrl_BlockJS env=cr-dev username=test@crosqa4.com password=test0000"

Runs a single test case (e.g., SingleUrl_BlockJS) against a device with the
specified IP address, using the Staging environment on the cros-dev DM Server,
and signing in to the device with the given username and password.
