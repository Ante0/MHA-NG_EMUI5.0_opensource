Verify effects of RestoreOnStartupURLs policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the RestoreOnStartupURLs user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior and appearance. It excercises a range of valid
policy values across three test cases.

A test case shall pass when a single browser tab is opened for only the URLs
specified in the policy value, and in the order specified (left to right).
A test case shall fail if the above behavior is not enforced.

Default useage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> policy_RestoreOnStartupURLs

Runs all three test cases using the local AutoTest fake DM server, and with
the default policy values defined by each test case.

Arguments useage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> policy_RestoreOnStartupURLs --args="env=prod
mode=single case=SingleUrl_1Tab value=http://www.irs.com"

Runs a single test case (e.g., SingleUrl_1Tab) against the production
environment, with an user-specified policy value of http://www.irs.com.

See accompanying README file for additional usage instructions and examples.
