Verify effects of policy_URLWhitelist policy on client behavior & appearance.

This test verifies the effect of the URLWhitelist user policy on Chrome OS
client behavior and appearance. It exercises a range of policy values using
three unique test cases, named: NotSet, SingleWhitelistedFile and
MultipleWhitelistedFiles.
See the test file for a full description of what each test case does.

The test case shall pass if:
 -only the URLs that are part of the URLWhitelist policy value are not blocked.
 -all other URLs are blocked.
The test case shall fail if the above behavior is not enforced.

Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> policy_URLWhitelist --args="mode=single
case=MultipleWhitelistedFiles nv=dm-test dms_name=xot-dmst
username=test@crosprqa1.com password=test1234"

This command runs a single test case (e.g., MultipleWhitelistedFiles) using
the specified test DM Server environment, signing in with the specified
username and password.
