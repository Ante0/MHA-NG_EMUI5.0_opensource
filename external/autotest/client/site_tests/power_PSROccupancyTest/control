Tests that PSR is entered on a static content.

The purpose of this test is to verify that display enters the PSR state when the
content being displayed is static. It also verifies that the display stays in
PSR state for as long as the display is static. It first enables PSR if not
enabled and makes the displayed content static. It then waits for some time,
after which it checks whether the display was in PSR state for close to
(<wait time> - <vblankoffdelay>).
