Verify effects of CookiesAllowedForUrls policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the CookiesAllowedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior when the DefaultCookiesSetting user policy is set
to 2. It exercises a range of policy values using four unique test cases:
NotSet_CookiesBlocked, SingleUrl_CookiesAllowed, MultipleUrls_CookiesAllowed,
and MultipleUrls_CookiesBlocked. See the test file for a full description of
what each test case does.

In general, a test shall pass if the browser allows cookies on a test page
with a URL that matches one or more of the URL patterns listed in the
CookiesAllowedForUrls policy value.

A test shall fail if the browser:
- Does not store cookies for URLs that match the URL patterns listed in the
  CookiesAllowedForUrls policy value.
- Stores cookies for URLs that do not match the URL patterns listed in the
  CookiesAllowedForUrls policy value.


Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> policy_CookiesAllowedForUrls --args="mode=single
case=SingleUrl_CookiesAllowed env=dm-test dms_name=xot-dmst
username=test@crosprqa4.com password=test0000"

Runs a single test case (e.g., SingleUrl_CookiesAllowed) against a device
with the specified IP address, using the DM Test environment with the given
DM Server name, and signing in to the device with the given username and
password.
