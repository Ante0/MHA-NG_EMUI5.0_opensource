Verify effects of EditBookmarksEnabled policy on client behavior & appearance.

This test verifies the effect of the EditBookmarksEnabled user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior and appearance. It exercises all valid policy
values across three test cases: True_Enabled, False_Disabled, and
NotSet_Enabled.

A test case shall pass if the Manage Bookmarks page allows (or forbids) the
user to add a new bookmark when the policy is true/notset (or false). A test
case shall fail if the above behavior is not enforced.

Default usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> EditBookmarksEnabled

Runs all three test cases using the local AutoTest fake DM server, and with
the policy json and expected values defined by each test case.

Arguments usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> EditBookmarksEnabled --args="env=prod
mode=single case=True username=test@crosprqa1.com password=test1234"

Runs a single test case (e.g., True) against the production environment, with
a specific username and password.

See accompanying README file for additional usage instructions and examples.
