Verify effects of PopupsBlockedForUrls policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the PopupsBlockedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior when the DefaultPopupsSetting policy is set to 1.
It exercises a range of policy values using four unique test cases, named:
NotSet_Allowed, 1Url_Blocked, 2Urls_Allowed, and 3Urls_Blocked. See the test
file for a full description of what each test case does.

In general, a test shall pass if the browser only blocks popups on a test page
that is in a domain listed in the PopupsBlockedForUrls policy. A test shall
fail if the browser blocks popups on a page where they should be allowed, or
allows popups on a page where they should be blocked.

Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> PopupsBlockedForUrls

Runs all the test cases against a device with the specified IP address, using
the DM Test environment with the given DM Server name, and signing in to the
device with the given username and password.
