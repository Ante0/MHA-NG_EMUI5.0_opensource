Verify effects of JavaScriptAllowedForUrls policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the JavaScriptAllowedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior when the DefaultJavaScriptSetting user policy is set
to 2. It exercises a range of policy values using four unique test cases,
named: NotSet_BlockJS, SingleUrl_AllowJS, MultipleUrls_BlockJS, and
MultipleUrls_AllowJS. See the test file for a full description of what each
test case does.

In general, a test shall pass if the browser allows JavaScript to execute only
on a test page with a URL that matches one or more of the URL patterns listed
in JavaScriptBlockedForUrls. A test shall fail if the browser blocks execution
on a page where it should be allowed, or allows execution on a page where it
should be blocked.

Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> JavaScriptAllowedForUrls --args="mode=single
case=SingleUrl_AllowJS env=dm-test dms_name=xot-dmst
username=test@crosprqa4.com password=test0000"

Runs a single test case (e.g., SingleUrl_AllowJS) against a device with the
specified IP address, using the DM Test environment with the given DM Server
name, and signing in to the device with the given username and password.
