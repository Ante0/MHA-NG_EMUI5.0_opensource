Verify effect of ManagedBookmarks policy on client behavior & appearance.

This test verifies the effect of the ManagedBookmarks user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior and appearance. It exercises a ranage of valid
policy values across three test cases: NotSet_NotShown, SingleBookmark_Shown,
and MultiBookmark_Shown.

A test case shall pass if the Manage Bookmarks page contains (or does not
contain) the domain-named bookmarks folder and the specified bookmarks when
its value is set (or is not set). A test case shall fail if the above behavior
is not enforced.

Default usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> ManagedBookmarks

Runs both test cases using the local AutoTest fake DM server, and with
the policy json and expected values as defined by each test case.
