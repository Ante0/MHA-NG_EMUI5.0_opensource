Verify effects of ImagesBlockedForUrls policy on client look and feel.

This test verifies the effect of the ImagesBlockedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior and appearance when the DefaultImagesSetting policy
is 1 or undefined. It exercises a range of policy values using four unique
test cases, named: NotSet, 1Url, 2Urls, and 3Urls. See the test file for a
full description of what each test case does.

In general, a test case shall pass if the browser only blocks images on a test
page that is in an domain listed in the ImagesBlockedForUrls policy. A test
case shall fail if the browser allows images to be shown on a page where they
should be blocked, or blocks images on a page where they should be shown.

Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> ImagesBlockedForUrls --args="mode=single case=2Urls
env=dm-test dms_name=xot-dmst username=test@crosprqa1.com password=test1234"

Runs a single test case (e.g., 2Urls) using the specified test DM Server
environment, signing in with the specified username and password. Expectation
is that the image on the page will be allowed (not blocked).
