  Verifies that a WiMAX module can connect to a WiMAX network.

  The test attempts to connect to a WiMAX network. It assumes that a WiMAX
  module is plugged in to the DUT and a WiMAX network is available. It repeats
  the connect/disconnect sequence several times. Each time after connecting to
  the WiMAX network, it fetches some data from a URL to confirm the WiMAX
  connectivity.
